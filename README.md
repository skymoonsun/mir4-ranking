You can change the world id from the mir4 official api link in the **/cron/ranking.php** file. *(it is currently set for the EU61 server.)*

You can access the database instance from the **/sql/mir4_db.sql** file.

This project was created to record and follow the progress of the members in Mir4. You can find the sample for the **EU61** server at [mir4.skymoonsun.dev](https://mir4.skymoonsun.dev "mir4.skymoonsun.dev").
